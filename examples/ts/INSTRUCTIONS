Compile the TypeScript project with npm:
```bash
npm install
npm run build
```
The `out/component_name.wasm` file is ready to be uploaded to Golem Cloud!

To do stub generation run the following command:
```bash
npm run stub
```

This will generate the typescript declaration files in `src/interfaces`
