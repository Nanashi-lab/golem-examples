See the documentation about installing tooling: https://learn.golem.cloud/docs/experimental-languages/js-ts/setup

Compile the TypeScript project with npm:
```bash
npm install
npm run componentize
```
The `out/component_name.wasm` file is ready to be uploaded to Golem Cloud!

All npm run commands:
  - stub: generates TypeScript mappings from the wit files
  - build: compiles and bundles the TypeScript sources
  - componentize: runs stub and build, then creates the wasm file for the component
  - clean: "rm -rf out src/interfaces src/main.d.ts"
